                    <p><article><b><h2><big>I am Kamohelo Elias Matoshela from Lesotho, Africa. I am a chess player and I sell chesssets too. I studied chess at Fisher's university in London where I got my 8 years' honours degree from. Learning at Fisher's was the best experience that has ever happed to me. I am now able to tutor different kinds of people. Whether they are old, young, stubborn or brilliant; I am able to handle them because of the remarkable skills I aquired at Fisher's. I had helped many students from various continents in the world when it comes to thier chess studies. I once had a student from France whom I am proud of, who was regarded as an alien in this game because of her good performance. I never thought she could do it, as a result I used one of my secret tecniques to teach her. If you want your children to outsmart their physics and mathematics classmates in tests then I've got your back. You can count on me because once I teach people chess, they begin to use minds at different perspective. Yes! it is true since it is scientifically proved that chessplayers excel when it comes to any activity that requires a person to think a lot. I already stated above that I am a businessman too, I do sell different kinds and types of chesssets as well as table chessbords. In the business world I was introduced since I knew that a dollar and two dollars makes three dollars. Even though I did not use to sell chesssets like I do recently, but I know how to manage customers and employees well. I learned business phychology online and I have two years certificate. I sell only quality goods since I know as a chessplayer what chesssets are bestchoices, I sell electronic, plastic, gold and wood chesssets.
